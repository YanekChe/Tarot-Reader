# Tarot-Reader

Tarot-Reader is a Python project that provides an AI-powered tarot card reading program with a graphical user interface (GUI). The program loads a tarot card deck, allows the user to draw one to three cards, and then uses OpenAI's text-davinci-002 engine to provide interpretations for the cards drawn.


<br><b>Usage</b></br>
<p>To use Tarot-Reader, you will need an API key from OpenAI to access the text-davinci-002 engine. You can obtain an API key by following the instructions on the OpenAI website.</p>

<p>Once you have obtained an API key, you can set it in the openai.api_key variable in the Readergui.py file. If you do not set the API key, the program will not work correctly.</p>
<p>To run the program, simply run the "Readergui.py" file. This will launch the graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to draw cards and receive interpretations.</p>


<br><b>Features</b></br>
<p>Draw one to three tarot cards at a time</p>
<p>Receive tarot card interpretations based on OpenAI's text-davinci-002 engine</p>
<p>Graphical user interface (GUI) for easy use</p>
