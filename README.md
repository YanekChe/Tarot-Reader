# Tarot-Reader
Tarot-Reader is a Python project that provides an AI-powered tarot card reading program with a graphical user interface (GUI). The program loads a tarot card deck, allows the user to draw one to three cards, and then uses OpenAI's text-davinci-002 engine to provide interpretations for the cards drawn.
Usage
To run the program, simply run the "Readergui.py" file. This will launch the graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to draw cards and receive interpretations.
